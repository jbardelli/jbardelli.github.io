This article shows the application of image segmentation and blob analysis in order to calculate the pore size distributions and pore parameters of sedimentary rocks from a thin section image.   

# Background
Petrographic image analysis is very useful to extract many parameters of both grains and pores in a sedimentary rock. Images are obtained from a thin section of the rock (tipically 30 microns) in a transmited light microscope. In these thin sections, pores are filled with an epoxy resin with blue dye, so that pores have a very distinct colour that is not confused with any mineral on the rock.
